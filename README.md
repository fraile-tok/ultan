# Ultan – Terminal-First Worldbuilding Dialectic Tool
Named after Master Ultan from Gene Wolfe's _The Book of the New Sun_. 

Ultan's purpose is simple: to help your worldbuilding by asking non-promptlike, relevant questions that help you further develop your own work.

## Roadmap
What follows is a list of functionalities Ultan will slowly get:

- AI interviewer that asks relevant, non-promptlike questions to user.
- AI summarizer, that records user's answer into a world's codex.
- Beautiful Terminal UI
